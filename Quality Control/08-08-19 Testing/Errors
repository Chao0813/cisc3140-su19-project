--Template Not Found--
Logging into: http://localhost/login/
Error received:
jinja2.exceptions.TemplateNotFound
jinja2.exceptions.TemplateNotFound: baseLoggedIn.html

Fixes:
http://localhost:8080/ is used instead of http://localhost:8080/login
Changed "basedLogin.html" in calling_api.py --> "base.html"

--New Connection Error--
http://localhost:8080/user/chalshaff12 doesn't work anymore instead it displays the following.

Error recieved:
requests.exceptions.ConnectionError
requests.exceptions.ConnectionError: HTTPConnectionPool(host='127.0.0.1', port=5000):
